## The Problem  

In Coimbatore, India — and across the world — patients are still handed handwritten scraps as medical records.  
The Times of India reported that even in major government hospitals, people go home with nothing more than notes scribbled by doctors.  

In private hospitals, the situation is worse:  
- Records are locked inside.  
- Patients often have to repeat scans.  
- Extra costs pile up.  
- Sometimes, they even have to beg to get their own data.  

This is the *hospital monarchy*.  
Hospitals behave like kings — they keep the records, they decide who sees them.  
The patient? Just a subject in their kingdom.

## The Solution – Pulse  

Pulse breaks this monopoly. It gives patients a *digital health vault* they truly own.  

- Every report, every scan, every note — *instantly accessible, verifiable, and secure*.  
- Think of it as a *passport for health data*: always valid, always yours, usable anywhere.

## How It Works  

- *Blockchain* → Creates a digital fingerprint. Once added, no one — not even hospitals — can alter or delete your records.  
- *Web3 wallets* → Patients hold their own keys. Hospitals must request permission to access data.  
- *IPFS storage* → Decentralized and tamper-proof, ensuring availability even if one server fails.  
- *AI summaries* → Converts raw medical files into simple, clear insights so doctors spend less time reading notes and more time treating patients.

## Why It Works  

Pulse balances three things that matter most:

And it puts all of them directly in the patient’s hands.

## Ease of Adoption  

*For Patients*  
Most patients who need care the most are senior citizens. Pulse is designed with them in mind:  
- One simple dashboard.  
- Clear summaries.  
- Emergency access in a single click.  

It feels like the health booklet they’ve always carried — just smarter, safer, and digital.  

*For Hospitals*  
Pulse can work as a replacement *or* as a layer below existing EHR/EMR systems.  
- No need to throw away current systems.  
- Pulse integrates seamlessly.  
- Adds decentralization and patient control with *near-zero switching costs*.

## Impact  

- Record transfers: *days → seconds*  
- Duplicate tests: *reduced by 90%*  
- Fraudulent claims: *cut by 80%*  
- Administrative overhead: *reduced by 70%*  

Pulse means *no more monarchy*.  
The crown is back on the patient’s head — their records, their control, their choice.
